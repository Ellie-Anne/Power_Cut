The current rules (may change with play tests):

The aim of the game is to collect all of the people cards or have the most people cards at the end of the game.
Every turn you may play up to one action card and have to draw a card at the end.
End phase is initiated when the are no more cards left to draw.
End phase means that you must play an action card if you can on your turn.
The game finishes when there are no more action cards left to play or when someone gets all of the people cards.
